# ADR: Data Visualization Integration

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The application currently handles various data types including drafts, leaderboards, picks, and player information. Adding visualization capabilities would enhance data comprehension and user experience by presenting this information in graphical formats.

## Decision Drivers
1. Performance impact on the application
2. Bundle size considerations
3. Learning curve for developers
4. Maintainability
5. TypeScript support
6. Integration complexity with existing React components
7. Customization capabilities
8. Active community and documentation quality

## Considered Options

### 1. Visualization Libraries

#### Recharts
- Pros:
  - Built specifically for React
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - Responsive by default
  - Smaller bundle size compared to alternatives
  - Composable components align with React patterns
- Cons:
  - Limited advanced visualization types
  - Less customization compared to D3

#### Victory
- Pros:
  - React-specific with good TypeScript support
  - Consistent API
  - Good animation support
- Cons:
  - Larger bundle size
  - Can be slower with large datasets

#### Chart.js (with react-chartjs-2)
- Pros:
  - Well-established and battle-tested
  - Good performance
  - Extensive documentation
- Cons:
  - Not React-native
  - Less integrated with React patterns

### Decision: Recharts

We recommend using Recharts for the following reasons:
1. Native React integration aligns with our existing architecture
2. Smaller bundle size impact
3. Strong TypeScript support matches our tech stack
4. Simple learning curve for React developers
5. Good performance characteristics
6. Active maintenance and community support



## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Data Loading Strategy
- Implement lazy loading for visualization data
- Cache frequently accessed chart data
- Consider implementing websockets for real-time updates

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Implement data sampling for large datasets
- Use client-side data transformation when possible
- Implement progressive loading for complex visualizations

### 3. Accessibility
- Ensure all charts have proper ARIA labels
- Provide table view alternatives
- Include proper color contrast ratios

### 4. Mobile Considerations
- Implement responsive chart layouts
- Use touch-friendly interaction patterns
- Consider reduced data points for mobile views

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Add Recharts dependency
2. Implement basic chart components
3. Create data transformation utilities

### Phase 2: API Integration
1. Develop new API endpoints
2. Implement data fetching hooks
3. Add caching layer

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add interactive features
2. Implement real-time updates
3. Add export capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enhanced data comprehension
- Improved user engagement
- Better decision-making capabilities
- Modern, competitive feature set

### Negative
- Increased bundle size
- Additional API complexity
- New testing requirements
- Learning curve for team

### Neutral
- Need for additional documentation
- Regular maintenance of visualization components
- Potential need for data optimization
