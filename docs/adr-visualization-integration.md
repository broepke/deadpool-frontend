# ADR: Data Visualization Integration

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The application currently handles various data types including drafts, leaderboards, picks, and player information. Adding visualization capabilities would enhance data comprehension and user experience by presenting this information in graphical formats.

## Decision Drivers
1. Performance impact on the application
2. Bundle size considerations
3. Learning curve for developers
4. Maintainability
5. TypeScript support
6. Integration complexity with existing React components
7. Customization capabilities
8. Active community and documentation quality

## Considered Options

### 1. Visualization Libraries

#### Recharts
- Pros:
  - Built specifically for React
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - Responsive by default
  - Smaller bundle size compared to alternatives
  - Composable components align with React patterns
- Cons:
  - Limited advanced visualization types
  - Less customization compared to D3

#### Victory
- Pros:
  - React-specific with good TypeScript support
  - Consistent API
  - Good animation support
- Cons:
  - Larger bundle size
  - Can be slower with large datasets

#### Chart.js (with react-chartjs-2)
- Pros:
  - Well-established and battle-tested
  - Good performance
  - Extensive documentation
- Cons:
  - Not React-native
  - Less integrated with React patterns

### Decision: Recharts

We recommend using Recharts for the following reasons:
1. Native React integration aligns with our existing architecture
2. Smaller bundle size impact
3. Strong TypeScript support matches our tech stack
4. Simple learning curve for React developers
5. Good performance characteristics
6. Active maintenance and community support

## Required API Enhancements

  "interval": "daily"
}

// Response
{
  "data": [
    {
      "date": "2025-01-07",
      "totalPicks": 145,
      "uniqueUsers": 32,
      "averagePicksPerUser": 4.53
    },
    // ... more daily data points
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "totalDataPoints": 30,
    "aggregationType": "daily",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-02-06T20:23:39Z"
  }
}
```

### 2. Aggregation Endpoints
- Add `/api/analytics/aggregates` endpoint
  - Parameters: dimension, metric
  - Returns: Grouped data for pie/bar charts
  - Use Cases: Distribution of picks, player selections

Example Request/Response:
```typescript
// GET /api/analytics/aggregates?dimension=player_category&metric=pick_count
{
  "dimension": "player_category",
  "metric": "pick_count",
  "filters": {
    "timeframe": "current_season"
  }
}

// Response
{
  "data": [
    {
      "category": "Quarterbacks",
      "pickCount": 450,
      "percentage": 35.2
    },
    {
      "category": "Running Backs",
      "pickCount": 380,
      "percentage": 29.7
    },
    // ... other categories
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "totalPicks": 1280,
    "timeframe": "2024-2025 Season"
  }
}
```

### 3. Comparison Endpoints
- Add `/api/analytics/comparisons` endpoint
  - Parameters: entities, metrics
  - Returns: Comparative data
  - Use Cases: Bar charts comparing different metrics

Example Request/Response:
```typescript
// GET /api/analytics/comparisons
{
  "entities": ["top_5_players"],
  "metrics": ["draft_position", "actual_performance"],
  "timeframe": "current_season"
}

// Response
{
  "data": [
    {
      "playerName": "Tom Brady",
      "draftPosition": {
        "value": 12,
        "rank": 1
      },
      "actualPerformance": {
        "value": 285.4,
        "rank": 3
      }
    },
    // ... more player comparisons
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "season": "2024-2025",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-02-06T20:23:39Z",
    "metrics": {
      "draftPosition": {
        "unit": "position",
        "description": "Average draft position"
      },

        "position": "WR",
        "pickPercentage": 42.3,
        "trend": "increasing"
      }
    ],
    "remainingByTier": {
      "tier1": 5,
      "tier2": 12,
      "tier3": 28
    }

- Implement progressive loading for complex visualizations

### 3. Accessibility
- Ensure all charts have proper ARIA labels
- Provide table view alternatives
- Include proper color contrast ratios

### 4. Mobile Considerations
- Implement responsive chart layouts
- Use touch-friendly interaction patterns
- Consider reduced data points for mobile views

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
